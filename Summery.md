| **Feature Area**                     | **Description**                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multimodal Requirement Ingestion** | Accepts inputs from PDF, Word, XML, Markup, and ALM tools like Jira/Polarion             |
| **AI-Powered Test Generation**       | Uses Gemini/Vertex AI to parse requirements and generate test cases with compliance tags |
| **Compliance Mapping**               | Embeds FDA, IEC 62304, ISO 13485, GDPR rules into test logic and traceability            |
| **Traceability Matrix**              | Auto-generated bi-directional matrix linking requirements â†” test cases â†” defects         |
| **Enterprise Integration**           | Connects with Jira, Azure DevOps, Polarion via APIs for real-time sync                   |
| **GDPR-Compliant PoC Mode**          | Supports masked data and audit logs for privacy-safe pilot deployments                   |
| **Scalable Architecture**            | Microservices on Google Cloud with Firebase dashboards and BigQuery analytics            |
